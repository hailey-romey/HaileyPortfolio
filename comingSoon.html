            <h4>Welcome to my site!</h4>
            <p>
                I'm currently working on some case studies, come back soon to see some of my best work!
                In the meantime, check out this website for Twitter Emergencies, a prior student project 
                that I worked on with a team of other SFU students. It's a proposal for twitter that we 
                reconfigured from the ground up outside of class, leading to a Vancouver UX design award 
                nominaton under the category of best student project:

        <div class="about-text-col"> 
            <h4>Hailey Romey</h4>     
            <p>
                I believe an inspired project is engaging beyond a solution, it innovates new interactions and serves to inspire its audience. 

                Ever since getting my first digital camera (a Nikon coolpix, complete with 8 whole megapixels!) I've been 
                obsessed with telling stories through digital media. From sibling-acted stories to high school film sets 
                and eventually to sketching storyboards and app flows, I have always enjoyed crafting memorable, human-centric experiences. 
            
                I recently completed my Bachelor of Science in Interactive Arts and Technology at Simon Fraser University, and 
                I'm currently working to improve my compositional skills in both music and visual design. Right now I'm looking for UX design or Video Editing work, so let's work together!
